      <h3><a href="https://google.com/">Google</a></h3>

      <p>
        Google's page does a wonderful job of utilizing Hick's Law by
        eliminating everything else except the purpose of the page- which is to
        search. By keeping the page clean, Google makes it much less
        overwhelming to search on the internet.

      <h2>Contrast</h2>
      <h3><a href="http://adele25.tilda.ws/">Adele 25</a></h3>

      <p>
        Using the stark contrast of black and white, this website uses these
        opposites to highlight both Adele's face. They also used size contrast
        to draw the view to the number 25- in reference to her most recent
        album.

      <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://www.latimes.com/">Los Angeles Times</a></h3>

      <p>
        The LA Times utilizes the area provides by creating a clean and simple
        face, separating different sections using white space which allows views
        to easily scan the page while at the same time keeping an organized
        look.
